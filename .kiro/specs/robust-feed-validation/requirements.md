# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current RSS feed validation system in the Personal News Dashboard has limitations that prevent it from properly validating feeds and discovering feed URLs from websites. Users are experiencing failures when adding valid RSS feeds, with the system showing "Network Error - Failed to fetch" even for feeds that contain valid RSS content. The system needs to be enhanced to be more robust in validation and capable of automatically discovering feed URLs from websites when direct feed URLs fail.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically discover RSS feeds from a website URL, so that I can add feeds without needing to know the exact RSS feed URL.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter a website URL (e.g., https://techcrunch.com) THEN the system SHALL attempt to discover RSS feed URLs from that website
2. WHEN the system discovers multiple feed URLs THEN it SHALL present them as options for the user to choose from
3. WHEN no direct RSS feed is found at the entered URL THEN the system SHALL scan the website's HTML for feed discovery links
4. WHEN feed discovery links are found in HTML meta tags or link elements THEN the system SHALL extract and validate those URLs
5. IF multiple feeds are discovered THEN the system SHALL display feed titles and descriptions to help users choose

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle CORS issues and network problems gracefully, so that valid feeds are not rejected due to technical limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a direct feed request fails due to CORS THEN the system SHALL attempt to use a CORS proxy service
2. WHEN the primary RSS2JSON service fails THEN the system SHALL try alternative proxy services as fallbacks
3. WHEN a feed request times out THEN the system SHALL retry with increased timeout limits
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
5. WHEN all proxy attempts fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages explaining the issue

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to validate feed content more intelligently, so that feeds with valid RSS content are not incorrectly marked as invalid.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating RSS content THEN the system SHALL handle feeds with or without XML declarations
2. WHEN parsing feed content THEN the system SHALL be tolerant of minor XML formatting issues
3. WHEN a feed has valid RSS structure THEN it SHALL be marked as valid regardless of styling information
4. WHEN feed content includes namespaces THEN the system SHALL properly handle namespace-aware parsing
5. WHEN feed validation fails initially THEN the system SHALL attempt content cleanup and re-validation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to provide detailed feedback about validation attempts, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN feed validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages explaining the failure reason
2. WHEN multiple validation attempts are made THEN the system SHALL show progress and results for each attempt
3. WHEN feed discovery is performed THEN the system SHALL show what URLs were tried and their results
4. WHEN validation succeeds after retries THEN the system SHALL indicate which method was successful
5. WHEN providing error messages THEN they SHALL include actionable suggestions for resolution

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to cache validation results intelligently, so that repeated validation attempts are faster and don't overwhelm servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a feed is successfully validated THEN the result SHALL be cached for a reasonable time period
2. WHEN validation fails temporarily THEN the system SHALL cache the failure for a shorter period than successes
3. WHEN a user manually revalidates a feed THEN the cache SHALL be bypassed for that specific request
4. WHEN cached results expire THEN the system SHALL automatically revalidate feeds in the background
5. WHEN feed discovery results are obtained THEN they SHALL be cached to avoid repeated website scanning

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle different feed formats and variations, so that I can add feeds from various sources without compatibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering RSS 2.0 feeds THEN the system SHALL properly parse and validate them
2. WHEN encountering Atom feeds THEN the system SHALL properly parse and validate them
3. WHEN encountering RSS 1.0 (RDF) feeds THEN the system SHALL properly parse and validate them
4. WHEN feeds use different character encodings THEN the system SHALL handle them correctly
5. WHEN feeds have non-standard but valid structures THEN the system SHALL be tolerant and accept them
