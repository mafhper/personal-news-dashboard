  - Create feed metadata extraction from discovered feeds
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 4. Implement intelligent content cleanup and parsing improvements

  - Add content sanitization and cleanup methods for malformed RSS feeds
  - Implement namespace-aware XML parsing for better feed compatibility
  - Create tolerant parsing logic that handles minor XML formatting issues
  - Add support for RSS 1.0 (RDF), RSS 2.0, and Atom feed formats
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [x] 5. Create smart validation cache manager with different TTL strategies

  - Implement `SmartValidationCache` class with configurable TTL for different result types
  - Add cache cleanup and memory management functionality
  - Create cache statistics and monitoring capabilities
  - Implement cache invalidation and manual refresh mechanisms
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 6. Integrate feed discovery with the main validation flow

  - Modify the main validation method to attempt discovery when direct validation fails
  - Implement user selection interface for multiple discovered feeds
  - Add progress tracking and feedback during discovery process
  - Create fallback logic from direct validation to discovery
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 7. Enhance FeedManager component with improved validation UI

  - Add feed discovery results presentation with selection options
  - Implement validation attempt history display in the UI
  - Create actionable error messages with suggestions for users
  - Add retry buttons and manual revalidation controls
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 8. Implement duplicate feed detection and prevention system

  - Create `FeedDuplicateDetector` class to identify duplicate feeds across different URLs
  - Implement URL normalization logic to detect feeds with different URLs but same content
  - Add feed content fingerprinting using RSS channel metadata (title, description, link)
  - Create duplicate detection for feed registration, import, and export operations
  - Implement user-friendly duplicate resolution interface with merge/replace options
  - Add duplicate feed warnings in FeedManager component during feed addition
  - _Requirements: Data integrity, user experience, feed management_

- [x] 9. Implement OPML export functionality with duplicate prevention

  - Create `OPMLExportService` class to generate OPML files from feed collections
  - Implement OPML XML structure generation with proper feed metadata
  - Add feed categorization support in OPML export (folders/categories)
  - Create download functionality for generated OPML files
  - Add OPML validation to ensure proper XML structure
  - Implement duplicate detection during OPML export to prevent duplicate entries
  - Integrate OPML export button in FeedManager component UI
  - _Requirements: Feed management, data portability, user experience, data integrity_

- [x] 10. Create comprehensive test suite for enhanced validation system

  - Write unit tests for feed discovery service functionality

  - Add tests for CORS proxy management and fallback mechanisms
  - Implement performance tests for concurrent validation scenarios
  - Add tests for duplicate feed detection and prevention functionality
  - Add tests for OPML export functionality and file generation
  - _Requirements: All requirements (testing coverage)_
