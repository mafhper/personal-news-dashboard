# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines comprehensive improvements to enhance code quality, performance, security, and maintainability of the Personal News Dashboard. The improvements focus on implementing industry best practices, robust error handling, advanced monitoring, and enhanced user experience features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful feedback, so that I can continue using the app even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in any component THEN the application SHALL display a user-friendly error boundary instead of crashing
2. WHEN a network request fails THEN the system SHALL automatically retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
3. WHEN an RSS feed fails to load THEN the system SHALL show a specific error message and continue loading other feeds
4. IF an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging purposes
5. WHEN the application recovers from an error THEN the user SHALL be able to retry the failed operation

### Requirement 2: Advanced Performance Monitoring and Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive performance monitoring and optimization tools, so that I can identify and resolve performance bottlenecks proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL track and report Core Web Vitals metrics
2. WHEN components render slowly THEN the system SHALL log performance warnings with detailed timing information
3. WHEN memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger cleanup operations
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide actionable insights and recommendations
5. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL display a performance dashboard with real-time metrics

### Requirement 3: Robust Logging and Debugging System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a structured logging system with different log levels, so that I can effectively debug issues and monitor application behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging events THEN the system SHALL support DEBUG, INFO, WARN, and ERROR log levels
2. WHEN in production THEN the system SHALL only log WARN and ERROR level messages
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL include contextual information like user actions and application state
4. IF logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL format logs consistently with timestamps and context
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL send error reports to monitoring services

### Requirement 4: Enhanced User Experience Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved loading states and feedback mechanisms, so that I understand what the application is doing at all times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is loading THEN the system SHALL display skeleton loaders that match the expected content layout
2. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL show success notifications with appropriate messaging
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display contextual error messages with suggested actions
4. IF notifications are shown THEN the system SHALL allow users to dismiss them or they SHALL auto-dismiss after appropriate time
5. WHEN performing long operations THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators with estimated completion time

### Requirement 5: Security Enhancements

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data and browsing to be secure, so that I can trust the application with my personal information and RSS feeds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing RSS content THEN the system SHALL sanitize all HTML content to prevent XSS attacks
2. WHEN validating URLs THEN the system SHALL only allow HTTP and HTTPS protocols
3. WHEN loading external resources THEN the system SHALL enforce Content Security Policy restrictions
4. IF malicious content is detected THEN the system SHALL block it and log the attempt
5. WHEN storing data locally THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all input data

### Requirement 6: Advanced Caching and Offline Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work efficiently offline and cache content intelligently, so that I can access my news even without internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL serve cached articles and maintain basic functionality
2. WHEN caching resources THEN the system SHALL use appropriate cache strategies for different content types
3. WHEN cache storage is full THEN the system SHALL intelligently evict old content using LRU algorithm
4. IF network connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL sync new content in the background
5. WHEN cache is updated THEN the system SHALL notify users of new content availability

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, so that I can confidently deploy changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage for critical components
2. WHEN testing user interactions THEN the system SHALL include end-to-end tests for primary user flows
3. WHEN testing performance THEN the system SHALL include benchmark tests to prevent performance regressions
4. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL run all tests and block deployment if critical tests fail

### Requirement 8: Configuration Management and Environment Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized configuration management, so that I can easily manage different environments and feature flags.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the application THEN the system SHALL use a centralized configuration system
2. WHEN switching environments THEN the system SHALL load appropriate configuration values automatically
3. WHEN feature flags are toggled THEN the system SHALL enable/disable features without code changes
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation errors and fallback to defaults
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL validate changes before applying them

### Requirement 9: Analytics and User Behavior Tracking

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want to understand how users interact with the application, so that I can make data-driven decisions for future improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with features THEN the system SHALL track usage analytics while respecting privacy
2. WHEN tracking events THEN the system SHALL include relevant context and user journey information
3. WHEN in production THEN the system SHALL send analytics data to configured analytics services
4. IF users opt out THEN the system SHALL respect privacy preferences and disable tracking
5. WHEN analyzing data THEN the system SHALL provide insights about feature usage and performance

### Requirement 10: Progressive Web App Enhancements

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced PWA features like offline support and app-like behavior, so that I can use the news dashboard as a native-like application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing the PWA THEN the system SHALL provide a native app-like experience
2. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL maintain core functionality and show appropriate offline indicators
3. WHEN new content is available THEN the system SHALL notify users through push notifications (if enabled)
4. IF the app is updated THEN the system SHALL prompt users to refresh for the latest version
5. WHEN using shortcuts THEN the system SHALL support keyboard shortcuts and quick actions
